# Parallelization-of-Floyd-Warshall-algorithm<br/>


Worked on a programming project that focuses on devising a parallel solution for the shortest path Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm. The main goal of the solution is to use parallel programming design paradigm to improve the performance of the algorithm on multiprocessor architecture. The solution proves that the algorithm achieves performance improvement in terms of run time compared to the sequential solution. The program does a sequential and a parallel run to demonstrate the improvement.
